For this assignment i've used my little personal project (Taxi analogue).

First of all I created the collection for entire project. Then i've added the variables ("url", "authToken") for this collection to comfortable usage. Then i divided requests by folders.
I've created the login request and post-response script, so after login, the token automatically has been set to this collection, instead of doing it manually.

1) The login test has been passed successfully!
2) Order creation test has been passed successfully!
3) Get vacant orders test has been passed successfully!
4) Delete order by id test has been passed successfully!
